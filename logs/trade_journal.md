 # 2026-07-21 09:50 AM EDT — Scheduled Rebalance Check — EXECUTED (Alpha Leader COIN Triggers GET THE PROFITS Sale at +4.30% Gain — $210.87 Realized, No Alpha Buy This Cycle; PLTR/TQQQ/META All Overweight but Negative-Margin-Blocked; 6 First-Time-Trade Underweight Buys Pro-Rata Funded via Reserve Bridge)

**Status:** EXECUTED. **7 of 7 intended orders filled** (1 sell, 6 buys) —
fresh, stateless run for the 9:45 AM ET scheduled tick. `CLAUDE.md`
re-pulled fresh from `main` (SHA `56bdab8`, text version header "Volume
2.28.0"). `portfolio_targets.json` (v2.17.0), `peak/prices.json`, and
`settlement/reserve.json` all re-pulled fresh from `main` for this run.

## Pre-check state (~9:46 AM ET, regular hours)
* Account `795732718` ("Agentic", cash-type). `buying_power` =
  **$9,280.58**, `cash` (ledger) = **$9,280.58** — no gap, confirms no
  unsettled proceeds carried in from a prior cycle.
* `current_cash` = Math.min($9,280.58, `cap_on_total_cash_balance_to_use`
  $10,000) = **$9,280.58**.
* Equity value (live quotes, 21 held target symbols; MU, SOXL, IONQ at
  zero shares under liquidation cooldown/recovery-fail; F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE
  still unpurchased first-time-trade targets): broker `get_portfolio`
  snapshot **$37,033.75**. `account_balance` ≈ **$46,314.33**.
* `settlement/reserve.json`: `pending_draws` = `[]` — nothing to
  reconcile. `reserve_available_to_draw` = `settlement_reserve_target`
  ($9,000) − $0 drawn = **$9,000** (fully available at cycle start).

## Drawdown audit (Step 1)
Checked every held asset against `max_trailing_drawdown_percentage`
(25%) vs both `peakPrice` and `avg_cost_basis`. **No asset breached 25%
on either leg** this cycle — closest was SPCX (19.6% off its $152.9988
peak). No emergency liquidations triggered.

## Liquidation recovery / cooldown check (Step 2)
* **MU**: liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $862.81. Only 5 days elapsed vs
  `cool_down_period_after_lquidation` (8 days) — still locked out
  regardless of price. Stays out of drift calc.
* **SOXL**: liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $147.6401. Same 5-day cooldown gate —
  still locked out. Stays out of drift calc.
* **IONQ**: liquidated 2026-07-13 @ $38.8001. Cooldown cleared (8 days
  elapsed), but current price $34.88 is **10.1% below** the liquidated
  price (a further decline, not a ≥7% recovery) — recovery condition
  fails. Stays out of drift calc.

## Drift & Alpha Leader (Step 3)
Target weights sum to 52.3 across 30 symbols. Drift computed against
`account_balance` ≈ $46,314.33 (`drift_tolerance_percentage` 2.0% /
0.1% for never-purchased first-time assets).

**Overweight (>2.0% drift):**
| Symbol | Current % | Target % | Drift |
|---|---|---|---|
| META | 15.61% | 1.91% | +13.69% |
| TQQQ | 5.61% | 2.87% | +2.74% |
| PLTR | 7.48% | 4.78% | +2.70% |

**Underweight first-time-trade (0% held, 0.1% tolerance):** F, GM, IBM,
NFLX, UNH, GE — all ~1.91% target drift, all first purchases this cycle.

All other held positions (INTC, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, ORCL, GOOG, MSFT,
MSTR, ARM, SMCI, HOOD, AAPL, AMD, NEE, VRT, AVGO, SPCX) sat inside the
2.0% band — no action.

**Alpha Leader — COIN (+7.62% over 7 days)**, computed from 07-14 close
$161.50 → live $173.80 at scan time. Runner-up was MSFT (+3.87%);
TQQQ/HOOD/NFLX all posted double-digit *negative* 7-day moves and were
excluded from leadership contention.

**GET THE PROFITS check on COIN:** avg cost basis $166.64, current price
$173.80 at scan time → unrealized gain **+4.30%**, exceeding
`materialize_profit_percentage` (4.0%). `peak/prices.json` shows no
prior `profitSellDate` for COIN (null) — rule **triggers**. Per
CLAUDE.md: sell `profit_sell_percentage` (40%) of COIN and **do not buy
any new Alpha Leader shares this cycle**, even though COIN's own
drift (target 1.91% vs. held 1.13%, i.e. technically underweight) would
otherwise argue for a buy.

`base_deployable_cash` = Math.max(0, $9,280.58 − $250 `min_cash_absolute`
− $9,000 `settlement_reserve_target`) = **$30.58** — the alpha
multiplier math was moot since no Alpha Leader buy occurs this cycle.

## Profit-taking & overweight evaluation (Step 4)
Guard check `overweight_sell_minimum_profit_margin_percent` (1.0%) on
all three overweight candidates — **none qualify, none are in
`forceSell`**:
| Symbol | Avg Cost | Current | Margin | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLTR | $134.51 | $134.05 | −0.34% | BLOCKED |
| TQQQ | $73.92 | $70.0307 | −5.26% | BLOCKED |
| META | $664.01 | $648.905 | −2.28% | BLOCKED |

High-Beta Gain scoring computed for the record (30-day daily-return
regression vs. SPY) even though no trim executes:
| Symbol | Beta (30d) | Raw Gain % | High-Beta Gain Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| TQQQ | 5.53 | −5.26% | −29.10 |
| META | 1.71 | −2.28% | −3.87 |
| PLTR | 0.75 | −0.34% | −0.26 |

All three would have ranked TQQQ first for trimming had any cleared the
profit-margin floor — none did. **Zero overweight sell proceeds
generated this cycle**; the only sell executed is the COIN profit-take
below.

## Price-limit / volatility halts (Step 5)
3-day (`no_of_days_for_price_compare`) min/max window checked for all
buy/sell candidates:
* COIN sale: current $175.70–176.37 sits *above* the 3-day max ($166.57)
  — a rally, not a crash, so `sell_price_diff_limit` is not a factor
  (that guard only exempts drops, not new highs).
* F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE buys: all comfortably inside
  `buy_price_diff_limit` (5%) off their 3-day lows — largest was IBM at
  +4.05%, closest to the cap but still compliant.

## Execution (Step 6) — sequential, regular market hours
1. **SELL COIN** 1.200189 sh (40% of the 3.000472-share position) @
   avg **$175.7001** market → **$210.87** proceeds. Realized gain =
   ($175.7001 − $166.64) × 1.200189 = **+$10.87**. Order
   `6a5f78fc…f185`, filled 09:49:48 AM ET.
2. **BUY F** $40.24 → 2.837799 sh @ avg $14.1800. Order `6a5f7921…6297`,
   filled 09:50:25 AM ET.
3. **BUY GM** $40.24 → 0.512931 sh @ avg $78.4510. Order `6a5f7926…f3e`,
   filled 09:50:30 AM ET.
4. **BUY IBM** $40.24 → 0.190050 sh @ avg $211.7332. Order
   `6a5f792b…89a`, filled 09:50:35 AM ET.
5. **BUY NFLX** $40.24 → 0.595310 sh @ avg $67.5950. Order
   `6a5f792f…eb4`, filled 09:50:39 AM ET.
6. **BUY UNH** $40.24 → 0.093548 sh @ avg $430.1500. Order
   `6a5f7933…7d`, filled 09:50:43 AM ET.
7. **BUY GE** $40.24 → 0.117441 sh @ avg $342.6400. Order
   `6a5f7937…6bc`, filled 09:50:48 AM ET.

No order size fell below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10). Gross nominal
value sold ($210.87) was far under `seek_approval_value` ($10,000) — no
user-approval halt required. No buy/sell conflict on the same symbol
this cycle.

### Settlement reserve bridge
COIN's $210.87 sale proceeds had not yet posted to `buying_power`
(confirmed empirically: post-sale `cash` $9,491.45 vs. `buying_power`
still $9,280.58, a $210.87 gap). Total buy spend this cycle was $241.44
($40.24 × 6), exceeding the $30.58 `base_deployable_cash` floor by
$210.86 — bridged in full from the reserve against the fresh COIN sale:
* New `pending_draws` entry: symbol `COIN`, `saleProceeds` $210.87,
  `reserveDrawn` $210.87 (full bridgeable capacity, well under the
  $9,000 `reserve_available_to_draw`), `saleDate` 2026-07-21,
  `expectedSettleDate` 2026-07-22 (`settlement_lag_days` = 1),
  `settled: false`.
* `reserve_available_to_draw` after this draw = $9,000 − $210.87 =
  **$8,789.13**.

## Post-trade balances
* `cash` **$9,250.01**, `buying_power` **$9,039.14** (gap = $210.87,
  matches the pending COIN draw exactly).
* `equity_value` **$37,119.31**, `total_value` (account_balance)
  **$46,369.32**.
* Cash sits well above `min_cash_target` ($500) and `min_cash_absolute`
  ($250); the reserve wall-off ($9,000) plus min-cash floor account for
  the rest — consistent with "keep cash lean but never below floor."

## peak/prices.json updates
* **COIN**: `peakPrice` 167.12 → **176.195** (new high, `peakDate`
  2026-07-21); `profitSellPrice` → **175.7001**, `profitSellDate` →
  **2026-07-21** (first-ever profit-sell recorded for this asset);
  `lastPurchaseDate` unchanged (no buy this cycle).
* **GM**: `peakPrice` 77.42 → **77.74** (new high, `peakDate`
  2026-07-21); `lastPurchaseDate` → **2026-07-21** (first purchase).
* **F, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE**: `lastPurchaseDate` → **2026-07-21** (first
  purchase); `peakPrice`/`peakDate` unchanged — current prices did not
  exceed stored peaks.
* All other symbols: peaks unchanged (no new highs this cycle).

## Total_High_Beta_Gains_Realized
$0.00 from overweight trims (all blocked by profit-margin guard).
COIN's profit-take realized **+$10.87** separately under the GET THE
PROFITS rule (not an overweight trim, so excluded from the High-Beta
Gains tally by definition, logged here for completeness).

## Reconciliation
`settlement/reserve.json` had zero pending entries at cycle start — no
prior-cycle settlements to reconcile. One new pending draw recorded
this cycle (COIN, see above).

 # 2026-07-20 03:22 PM EDT — Scheduled Rebalance Check — EXECUTED (Alpha Leader Rotates to AAPL as Profit-Sell Repurchase Lock Finally Clears — $16.47 Alpha Buy Filled; Runners-Up MSTR/PLTR Blocked by Pump-Limit Guard; Zero Legal Overweight Sell Source Persists; 6 First-Time-Trade Underweight Buys Pro-Rata Split Below $10 Floor)

**Status:** EXECUTED. **1 of 1 intended order filled** — fresh, stateless
run for the 3:15 PM ET scheduled tick. `CLAUDE.md` re-pulled fresh from
`main` (SHA `70f9b43`, text version header "Volume 2.28.0", unchanged
since this morning's 9:47 AM cycle). `portfolio_targets.json` (v2.17.0),
`peak/prices.json`, and `settlement/reserve.json` all re-pulled fresh
from `main` for this run.

## Pre-check state (~3:16 PM ET, regular hours)
* Account `795732718` ("Agentic", cash-type). `buying_power` =
  **$9,297.05**, `cash` (ledger) = **$9,297.05** — no gap, identical to
  this morning's 9:47 AM reading; `get_equity_orders` confirms zero
  orders placed on this account since midnight ET prior to this cycle.
* `current_cash` = Math.min($9,297.05, `cap_on_total_cash_balance_to_use`
  $10,000) = **$9,297.05**.
* Equity value (live quotes, 21 held target symbols; MU, SOXL, IONQ at
  zero shares under liquidation cooldown; F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE still
  unpurchased first-time-trade targets): broker `get_portfolio` snapshot
  **$36,652.69**. `account_balance` ≈ **$45,949.74**.
* `settlement/reserve.json`: `pending_draws` = `[]` — nothing to
  reconcile. `reserve_available_to_draw` = `settlement_reserve_target`
  ($9,000) − $0 drawn = **$9,000** (unused, no draws needed this cycle).

## Drawdown audit (Step 1)
Checked every held asset against `max_trailing_drawdown_percentage`
(25%) vs both `peakPrice` and `avg_cost_basis`. Broad down day
continuing from this morning across the target list, but **no asset
breached 25% on either leg** — closest were SPCX (20.8% off peak / 20.0%
off cost basis) and INTC (16.1% off peak / 22.8% off cost basis).
**Zero emergency liquidations triggered.**

## Drift assessment (Step 1–2)
Drift breaches (> `drift_tolerance_percentage` 2.0% for established
holdings, > `drift_tolerance_percentage_for_first_time_trades` 0.1% for
never-purchased targets — F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE all show
`lastPurchaseDate: null`):
* **Overweight, breaching:** TQQQ (current 5.47% vs. target 2.87%, drift
  +2.61pp), PLTR (current 7.62% vs. target 4.78%, drift +2.84pp),
  **META (current 15.72% vs. target 1.91%, drift +13.81pp — persistent
  large overweight)**.
* **Underweight, breaching (first-time-trade tolerance):** F, GM, IBM,
  NFLX, UNH, GE — each 0% held vs. ~1.91% target, 1.91pp drift.
* MU, SOXL, IONQ remain **excluded from drift calc** — liquidation
  cooldown (8 days) not yet cleared: MU/SOXL liquidated 2026-07-16 (4 of
  8 days elapsed), IONQ liquidated 2026-07-13 (7 of 8 days elapsed, 1
  day short).

Since breaches exist, the cycle proceeds past the "no trades needed"
early-exit check.

## Overweight sell-source screen (Step 2/4)
All three actionable Overweight assets screened against
`overweight_sell_minimum_profit_margin_percent` (1.0%) — `forceSell` is
empty, no override available. Lock-in check (`lock_in_period` 2 days)
also run: TQQQ (`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-16, 4 days — clear) and META
(`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-16, 4 days — clear) are both past lock-in,
but neither clears the profit-margin gate anyway:
* TQQQ: avg cost $73.92 vs. current $67.87 → **−8.18%** (loss) — not
  sellable.
* PLTR: avg cost $134.51 vs. current $135.61 → **+0.82%** — below the
  1.0% floor, not sellable.
* META: avg cost $664.01 vs. current $648.77 → **−2.30%** (loss) — not
  sellable.

**Zero legal overweight trim source this cycle** — unchanged from this
morning. No High-Beta Gain Score ranking was computable (no candidate
cleared the profit-margin gate to be trim-eligible).

## Alpha Leader identification & multiplier (Step 3)
7-day price gain computed for all 30 target-list symbols (2026-07-13
official close → live 2026-07-20 ~3:16 PM ET quote):
1. **MSTR +5.82%** — highest 7-day gain, but current price ($97.46) sits
   **+8.22%** above its trailing 3-day low ($90.06, set 2026-07-17),
   over the 5% `buy_price_diff_limit` — **exempt from buying today**
   (parabolic-rally guard; worse than this morning's 6.16% reading as
   the rally extended into the afternoon).
2. **PLTR +4.28%** — runner-up, current price ($135.61) sits **+5.39%**
   above its trailing 3-day low ($128.68, set 2026-07-16), also over the
   5% limit — **exempt from buying today** (also already an Overweight
   position, drift +2.84pp).
3. **AAPL +3.38%** — third-highest and the first candidate clear of
   every guard:
   - **Repurchase lock check:** `profitSellDate` 2026-07-17 (3 days ago,
     clears the 2-day `sold_asset_repurchase_days` gate). Price has now
     dropped **1.63%** from `profitSellPrice` ($333.4801 → live
     $328.15), clearing the 1.5% `sold_asset_price_change_percentage`
     bar for the first time since the profit-sell (this morning's
     reading was only −0.88%, short of the bar). **Repurchase guard
     satisfied — AAPL is back in play.**
   - **Pump guard:** 3-day low $317.32 (2026-07-09... 2026-07-15 window
     used the 07-15/16/17 lows); current $328.15 is **+3.38%** above it,
     clear of the 5% limit.
   - **GET-THE-PROFITS check** (sell-side, run regardless of buy
     eligibility): raw gain vs. `avg_cost_basis` = +2.57% ($319.83 →
     $328.04 pre-trade), below the 4.0% `materialize_profit_percentage`
     bar — **not triggered**. Proceeds to BUY path.

`base_deployable_cash` = max(0, $9,297.05 − `min_cash_absolute` $250 −
`settlement_reserve_target` $9,000) = **$47.05**. No overweight trim
source exists to harvest `multiplier_cash` (would have been
$47.05 × 0.25 = $11.76), so the reinvestment multiplier (1.25×)
generated **$0** in practice this cycle — only the organic $47.05 base
is real.

**Alpha allocation:** `alpha_cash_allocation_percentage` (35%) of the
$47.05 base = **$16.4675 → $16.47**, routed to AAPL (Alpha Leader).
Resulting AAPL concentration post-trade is still a small fraction of
`max_portfolio_percentage` (35% cap) — no cap constraint bound.

## Underweight pro-rata coverage (Step 3, remainder)
Remaining base pool after the Alpha allocation = $47.05 − $16.47 =
**$30.58**. The only actionable Underweight assets are the six
first-time-trade targets (F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE), all equal-weighted
(1.0 each) and all clear of the `buy_price_diff_limit` pump guard
(largest: IBM at +4.42% off its 3-day low, still under the 5% cap).
Pro-rata split of $30.58 across 6 equal-weight targets = **$5.10
each** — below the `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) per-trade floor.
**All six buys evaluated and SKIPPED.**

## Execution (Step 6)
* **AAPL — BUY, market order, regular hours, $16.47 notional.**
  Reviewed via `review_equity_order` (zero broker alerts; quote at
  review: bid $328.12 / ask $328.14 / last $328.125, 3:21 PM ET).
  Placed via `place_equity_order` (ref_id
  `147c46b9-847d-4ad3-8f05-0eb839445b03`, order id
  `6a5e752d-faeb-4837-8972-a3fdd118ffb9`). **Filled** 2026-07-20
  19:21:17 UTC (3:21:17 PM ET) — 0.050190 shares @ avg price
  $328.1499, $16.47 total, $0.00 fees.
* No sells executed (zero legal overweight trim source; GET-THE-PROFITS
  not triggered). Per the same-cycle buy/sell exclusivity rule, this was
  moot — no conflicting sell was ever in play for AAPL.
* No `seek_approval_value` ($10,000) halt triggered — trade size $16.47
  is far below the threshold.
* No settlement-reserve draws created or reconciled this cycle — the buy
  was funded entirely from organic `buying_power`, no bridging
  required. `pending_draws` stayed empty throughout.

## Peak-price ledger (`peak/prices.json`)
* **AAPL**: repurchased after a prior profit-sell → `peakPrice` **reset**
  to the purchase fill price **$328.1499**, `peakDate` and
  `lastPurchaseDate` set to **2026-07-20**, per the repo rule to reset
  peak tracking on post-profit-sell repurchase. `profitSellPrice`
  ($333.4801) / `profitSellDate` (2026-07-17) preserved as historical
  record.
* All other 29 symbols: broad down day continuing — every held/tracked
  symbol's live price came in below its stored `peakPrice`, so no other
  peak values required updating.

## Final balances
* Cash (`buying_power`): **$9,280.58** post-trade (well above
  `min_cash_target` $500 lean-buffer goal, but still immobilized behind
  the $9,000 `settlement_reserve_target` wall and a now-exhausted $30.58
  residual — cannot be worked down further this cycle without a legal
  sell source).
* Equity value: **≈$36,653.74** (broker snapshot, post-trade).
* Account value: **≈$45,934.32** (broker snapshot, post-trade).
* Execution window: 2026-07-20 19:21:11–19:22:27 UTC (3:21:11–3:22:27 PM
  EDT), regular market hours.

`Total_High_Beta_Gains_Realized` this cycle: **$0.00** (no trim-eligible
candidates cleared the profit-margin gate; the only execution this cycle
was the AAPL Alpha Leader buy).

Per repo convention, this entry is committed to a fresh feature branch
and merged directly into `main` to preserve the unalterable paper
trail.

# 2026-07-20 09:47 AM EDT — Scheduled Rebalance Check — NO TRADES (Alpha Leader AAPL Blocked by Profit-Sell Repurchase Lockout; Runner-Up MSTR Blocked by Pump-Limit Guard; Zero Legal Overweight Sell Source; 6 First-Time-Trade Underweight Buys Pro-Rata Split Below $10 Floor)

**Status:** NO TRADES. **0 of 0 intended orders** — fresh, stateless run
for the 9:45 AM ET scheduled tick. `CLAUDE.md` re-pulled fresh from

* Account `795732718` ("Agentic", cash-type). `buying_power` = **$9,297.05**,

  `account_balance` ≈ **$46,152.43** (broker `get_portfolio` snapshot:
  $46,153.74, minor cross-call quote variance).
* `settlement/reserve.json`: `pending_draws` = `[]` — nothing to
  reconcile. `reserve_available_to_draw` = `settlement_reserve_target`
  ($9,000) − $0 drawn = **$9,000** (unused, no draws needed this cycle).

## Drawdown audit (Step 1)
Checked every held asset against `max_trailing_drawdown_percentage`
(25%) vs both `peakPrice` and `avg_cost_basis`. Broad down day across
the target list but **no asset breached 25% on either leg** — closest
was SPCX (19.8% off peak / 19.0% off cost basis). **Zero emergency
liquidations triggered.**

## Drift assessment (Step 1–2)
Drift breaches (> `drift_tolerance_percentage` 2.0% for established
holdings, > `drift_tolerance_percentage_for_first_time_trades` 0.1% for
never-purchased targets):
* **Overweight, breaching:** TQQQ (+2.78pp), PLTR (+2.71pp), **META
  (+13.62pp — persistent large overweight)**.
* **Underweight, breaching (first-time-trade targets, 0 shares held):**
  F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE — each 1.91pp underweight vs. 0.1% tolerance.
* MU, SOXL, IONQ remain **excluded from drift calc** — all three were
  liquidated within the last `cool_down_period_after_lquidation` (8
  days): MU/SOXL liquidated 2026-07-16 (4 days ago), IONQ liquidated
  2026-07-13 (7 days ago, 1 day short of cooldown clearing).

Since breaches exist, the cycle proceeds past the "no trades needed"
early-exit check.

## Overweight sell-source screen (Step 2/4)
All three actionable Overweight assets were screened against
`overweight_sell_minimum_profit_margin_percent` (1.0%) — `forceSell` is
empty, so none get an override:
* TQQQ: −4.92% (loss) — **not sellable**
* PLTR: −0.43% (loss) — **not sellable**
* META: −3.05% (loss) — **not sellable**
* SPCX (overweight but below tolerance, not actionable): −19.03% (loss)

**Zero legal overweight trim source this cycle** — every candidate is
currently underwater on cost basis. No High-Beta Gain Score ranking was
computable (no candidate cleared the profit-margin gate to be
trim-eligible).

## Alpha Leader identification & multiplier (Step 3)
7-day price gain computed for all 30 target-list symbols (2026-07-13
close → live 2026-07-20 quote):
1. **AAPL +4.17%** — highest 7-day gain, but **blocked from any new buy**:
   `profitSellDate` 2026-07-17 (3 days ago, clears the 2-day
   `sold_asset_repurchase_days` gate), but price has only dropped 0.88%
   from `profitSellPrice` ($333.48 → $330.545), short of the required
   `sold_asset_price_change_percentage` (1.5%). Repurchase guard not
   satisfied — AAPL stays out of play.
   - GET-THE-PROFITS check run anyway (sell-side, not buy-gated):
     raw gain vs. `avg_cost_basis` = +3.35%, below the 4.0%
     `materialize_profit_percentage` bar — **not triggered**.
2. **MSTR +3.81%** — runner-up, but current price ($95.605) sits 6.16%
   above its trailing 3-day low ($90.06), over the 5% `buy_price_diff_limit`
   — **exempt from buying today** (parabolic-rally guard).
3. **PLTR +2.99%** — next-highest and the only one of the top three
   clear of both guards (3-day-low rally = +4.08%, under the 5% limit;
   no liquidation/profit-sell lockout). Raw gain vs. cost basis = −0.43%
   (loss), so GET-THE-PROFITS does not apply to it either.

Net effect: the two best-performing candidates are both buy-blocked by
explicit guardrails this cycle, so **no Alpha Multiplier cash was
routed to any single leader.**

`base_deployable_cash` = max(0, $9,297.05 − `min_cash_absolute` $250 −
`settlement_reserve_target` $9,000) = **$47.05**. No overweight trim
source exists to harvest `multiplier_cash`, so the reinvestment
multiplier (1.25×) generated **$0** in practice — only the organic
$47.05 base is real. With the Alpha allocation undeployable, this full
$47.05 rolled into the pro-rata underweight pool below rather than
sitting earmarked and idle.

## Underweight pro-rata coverage (Step 3, remainder)
The only actionable Underweight assets are the six first-time-trade
targets (F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE), all equal-weighted (1.0 each) and
all clear of the `buy_price_diff_limit` pump guard (largest: GE at
+4.46% off 3-day low, still under the 5% cap). Pro-rata split of the
$47.05 scarce pool across 6 equal-weight targets = **$7.84 each** —
below the `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) per-trade floor. **All six
buys evaluated and SKIPPED** — harvested pool too small to clear the
minimum trade size for any of them individually or in any sub-grouping
that still respects pro-rata weighting.

## Execution (Step 6)
**No orders were placed this cycle** — zero legal sell source, zero
buy-eligible Alpha Leader, and a deployable-cash pool too thin to clear
the per-trade floor on the only remaining actionable (first-time-trade)
targets. No `seek_approval_value` halt triggered (nothing sized for
approval). No settlement-reserve draws created or reconciled — `pending_draws`
stayed empty throughout.

## Peak-price ledger (`peak/prices.json`)
Broad down day across the target list — **every held/tracked symbol's
live price came in below its stored `peakPrice`**, so no peak values
required updating. File left unchanged (identical content re-verified
against `main`).

## Final balances
* Cash (`buying_power`): **$9,297.05** (well above `min_cash_target`
  $500 lean-buffer goal, but immobilized behind the $9,000
  `settlement_reserve_target` wall and the thin $47.05 deployable
  sliver — cannot be worked down further without a legal sell source).
* Equity value: **≈$36,855.38**
* Account value: **≈$46,152.43**
* Execution window: 2026-07-20 09:46:38–09:47 AM EDT, regular market
  hours (opened 9:30 AM ET).

## SKIPPED/PENDING trade matrix
| Symbol | Intent | Amount | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| AAPL | Buy (Alpha Leader, rank 1) | n/a | Profit-sell repurchase lockout — only 0.88% drop since last sell, needs ≥1.5% |
| MSTR | Buy (Alpha Leader, rank 2) | n/a | 3-day-low rally +6.16% exceeds 5% `buy_price_diff_limit` |
| F | Buy (pro-rata underweight) | $7.84 | Below $10 `sell_or_buy_value_limit` |
| GM | Buy (pro-rata underweight) | $7.84 | Below $10 `sell_or_buy_value_limit` |

| META | Sell (overweight trim) | n/a | −3.05% raw gain, below 1.0% profit-margin floor, not in `forceSell` |

`Total_High_Beta_Gains_Realized` this cycle: **$0.00** (no trim-eligible
candidates cleared the profit-margin gate).

Per repo convention, this entry is committed to a fresh feature branch

# 2026-07-17 03:19 PM EDT — Scheduled Rebalance Check — NO TRADES (GET-THE-PROFITS Cleared 4.0% Bar Again but Suppressed — AAPL Already Sold Twice Today; Zero Legal Overweight Trim Persists; 6 First-Time-Trade Underweight Buys Remain Unfunded on Zero Deployable Cash)

**Status:** NO TRADES. **0 of 0 intended orders** — fresh, stateless run
for the 3:15 PM ET scheduled tick. `CLAUDE.md` re-pulled fresh from
`main` (text unchanged since the 11:40 AM cycle, still v2.26.0).
`portfolio_targets.json` (v2.17.0), `peak/prices.json`, and
`settlement/reserve.json` all re-pulled fresh — all three unchanged in
structure from the 11:40 AM cycle except for that cycle's own AAPL
second-profit-sell fields and NFLX's new intraday peak.

## Pre-check state (~3:16 PM ET, regular hours)
* Account `795732718` ("Agentic", `cash`-type). `buying_power` =
  **$9,249.93**, `cash` (ledger) = **$9,297.05** — the $47.12 gap is the
  combined proceeds of today's two AAPL profit-take sells (9:50 AM
  $29.44 + 11:40 AM $17.68), still unsettled (`expectedSettleDate`
  2026-07-18, tomorrow).
* `current_cash` = Math.min($9,249.93, `cap_on_total_cash_balance_to_use`
  $10,000) = **$9,249.93**.
* Equity value (live quotes, 21 held target symbols; MU, SOXL, IONQ at
  zero shares; F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE still unpurchased): **≈$36,513.68**
  (broker `get_portfolio` snapshot: $36,511.16, minor cross-call quote
  variance). `account_balance` ≈ **$45,763.61**.
* Note: `get_portfolio` also reported a **`pending_deposits` value of
  $4,000** on this account — not yet reflected in `cash` or
  `buying_power`, and `CLAUDE.md` defines `current_cash` strictly off
  the settled `buying_power` field, so this deposit was **not** factored
  into any calculation this cycle. Flagging for visibility: once it
  clears, it will materially increase `base_deployable_cash` for a
  future cycle.

## Settlement Reserve reconciliation
* `settlement/reserve.json` = `{"pending_draws": []}` — no prior-cycle
  entries to reconcile. Neither of today's two AAPL sales was ever
  recorded as a draw (nothing drew on them, since no buy cleared the
  value floor in either prior cycle), so there is nothing to mark
  settled here; both will simply resolve into `buying_power` once they
  clear (expected tomorrow).
* `reserve_available_to_draw` = $9,000 − $0 = **$9,000** (full headroom).

## Drawdown Audit Phase — no breaches
Checked all 21 held target symbols under the dual-condition test (≥25%
down from both `peakPrice` and `avg_cost_basis`). The broad market
pullback from this morning continued into the afternoon (nearly every
held symbol down further from the 11:40 AM check), but closest
approaches remained **INTC** (−18.15% vs. peak, −24.74% vs. avg cost —
fails the peak leg by a solid margin) and **SPCX** (−18.00%/−17.25%,
both clear of 25%). **No symbol clears both legs — no emergency
liquidations this cycle.** No new intraday peaks recorded — every held
symbol traded below its recorded high this afternoon.

## Rules & Guardrails (Step 2)
* **MU** (liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $862.81): current $863.545 is a
  **+0.085%** move — technically a hair above the liquidated price, but
  nowhere near the required ≥7% recovery; `current_date` −
  `liquidatedDate` = 1 day, also short of the 8-day cooldown. **Remains
  excluded.**
* **SOXL** (liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $147.6401): current $133.23, a
  **−9.76%** further decline; cooldown not met. **Remains excluded.**
* **IONQ** (liquidated 2026-07-13 @ $38.8001): current $34.73, a
  **−10.49%** further decline. **Remains excluded.**
* **F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE**: no purchase ever recorded
  (`lastPurchaseDate: null`) → first-time-trade tolerance (0.1%) applies
  regardless of the `peakPrice` initialization entries created this
  morning. Each still 0% current vs. 1.912% target → **1.912% drift,
  breaching.**
* **AAPL** (`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-13): 4 days > `lock_in_period`
  (2) → not locked-in on its own terms (moot regardless — see the
  profit-materialization check below).
* **TQQQ**, **META** (`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-16): 1 day ≤
  `lock_in_period` (2) → both **locked-in for selling**.

## Drift Audit (`account_balance` ≈ $45,763.61, `drift_tolerance_percentage` = 2.0%)
**3 Overweight breaches:** PLTR (7.464% vs. 4.780% target, drift
2.684%), TQQQ (5.461% vs. 2.868%, drift 2.593%), **META** (15.616% vs.
1.912%, drift 13.704%). **6 Underweight breaches (first-time-trade
tolerance):** F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE (1.912% drift each vs. 0.1%
tolerance). Aggregate dollar-gap across the six ≈ **$5,250.00** (≈$875
each, equal target weights). All other held symbols stayed inside the
standard 2.0% band (largest: SMCI 1.787%, ARM 1.668%, AAPL 1.854%).

## Overweight Sellability Check — none legal this cycle
| Symbol | Avg Cost | Current | Raw Gain % | Sellable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLTR | $134.51 | $132.26 | −1.67% | No — underwater, fails ≥1.0% floor |
| TQQQ | $73.92 | $67.42 | −8.79% | No — locked-in (1-day-old purchase) *and* underwater |
| META | $664.01 | $641.90 | −3.33% | No — locked-in (1-day-old purchase) *and* underwater |

**Zero legal trim source among Overweight positions.**
`Total_High_Beta_Gains_Realized` (Overweight-trim component) = **$0.00**.

## Alpha Leader (7-day gain, 2026-07-10 open → live ~3:16 PM ET)
| Symbol | 7-Day Gain |
|---|---|
| **AAPL** | **+6.042%** |
| F | +5.049% |
| MSFT | +1.831% |
| NEE | +1.710% |
| PLTR | +0.091% |

**AAPL remains Alpha Leader**, holding its lead from the two earlier
cycles today (+5.834% → +6.135% → +6.042%, a slight afternoon
compression as AAPL itself eased marginally off its own intraday high
while the broader list continued softening).

## Step 4 "GET THE PROFITS" Check — **CLEARED THE BAR, BUT SUPPRESSED (already sold today)**
* AAPL's raw unrealized gain on its average cost basis (unchanged,
  $319.83 — no buys since) = **+4.347%** ((333.7346 − 319.83) / 319.83 ×
  100).
* `materialize_profit_percentage` = **4.0%**. **4.347% ≥ 4.0% — the
  underlying profit condition is met for a third consecutive time
  today.** However, per `CLAUDE.md`: *"If there are any previous sales
  on Alpha Leader within todays business day, do not trigger GET THE
  PROFITS sale again."* AAPL was already sold twice today under this
  exact rule (9:50 AM and 11:40 AM, both same-day). **This explicit
  same-day guard fires and suppresses the sale this cycle** — no third
  AAPL profit-take was executed, and none was warranted by the rule as
  written.
* Since no sale was triggered this cycle, the narrower v2.26.0
  buy-suppression clause (bar only same-cycle Alpha Leader re-buys) is
  moot — it only applies when a sale actually fires. AAPL's own drift
  (1.854%, current vs. target) is inside the standard 2.0% tolerance
  anyway, so no buy would have been warranted for it regardless.

## Step 3 — Alpha Leader & Re-investment Multiplier
* `base_deployable_cash` = Max(0, $9,249.93 − $250 − $9,000) = **$0.00**
  (raw calc −$0.07, floored) — no organic deployable cash. No base or
  multiplier allocation to the Alpha Leader this cycle.

## Step 4 — Underweight / Multiplier Funding
* **No Overweight position is legally sellable** (PLTR/TQQQ/META all
  underwater and/or locked-in — see above), so there is no harvestable
  capital.
* **No Alpha Leader profit-take proceeds this cycle** (suppressed by the
  same-day guard), unlike the two prior cycles today where AAPL's own
  trim proceeds funded a token pro-rata pool.
* Net result: **zero capital available** to fund the six first-time-trade
  Underweight breaches (F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE) — a harder stop than
  the 11:40 AM cycle's "funded but below the $10 floor" outcome; this
  cycle there is no pool to divide at all.

## Step 5 — Price Limit Checks
Not applicable — no trade candidates survived Steps 3/4 to reach a price
check (no sell candidate, no funded buy candidate).

## Step 6 — Execution
**No orders placed.** Gross nominal value **sold** this cycle: $0.
`seek_approval_value` never in play. No 429 throttling encountered.

## Post-check state
* `buying_power`/`cash` unchanged: **$9,249.93** / **$9,297.05**.
  `min_cash_absolute` ($250) never at risk (nothing spent).
* Equity value: **$36,513.68** (live quotes at check time). Total
  account value ≈ **$45,763.61** (using `current_cash` = `buying_power`
  methodology per `CLAUDE.md`; broker snapshot `total_value` =
  $45,808.21, using the raw `cash` ledger instead).

## peak/prices.json updates
* **None.** No held symbol printed a new high this cycle — the broad
  afternoon pullback pulled every symbol (including this morning's NFLX
  recovery high) below its recorded peak. No re-entry triggers, no
  purchases/liquidations/profit-sells this cycle. File left untouched.

## Settlement Reserve — no new draws
* No sale this cycle (nothing to bridge from) and no buy this cycle
  (nothing to bridge to). `reserve_available_to_draw` remains **$9,000**
  for the next cycle. `settlement/reserve.json` unchanged:
  `{"pending_draws": []}`.

## Notes
* This was the scheduled 3:15 PM ET tick, run fresh with no memory of
  prior cycles. The main development this cycle: AAPL's unrealized gain
  cleared the `materialize_profit_percentage` bar for a **third**
  consecutive check today (4.14% → 4.45% → 4.35%, oscillating but
  staying above 4.0% as AAPL held up while the broader list weakened
  further), but the standing same-day guard — *"if there are any
  previous sales on Alpha Leader within todays business day, do not
  trigger GET THE PROFITS sale again"* — correctly prevented a third
  trim. This is the first cycle today where that specific guard was the
  operative reason profit-taking didn't fire (the two earlier cycles
  fired the sale itself). With no profit-take proceeds and no legal
  Overweight trim, this cycle had strictly less capital available than
  the 11:40 AM cycle ($0 vs. that cycle's $17.68), so the six
  first-time-trade Underweight targets (F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE)
  remain fully unfunded, now three consecutive cycles running. Worth
  flagging forward: a **$4,000 `pending_deposits`** entry appeared on
  the account this cycle (not yet settled/spendable, and per
  `CLAUDE.md`'s `buying_power`-based definition of `current_cash`, not
  used in any calculation above) — once it clears, `base_deployable_cash`
  will jump well past the six-symbol funding threshold. Also worth
  noting: the six first-time symbols' `peakPrice` entries were
  initialized this morning purely to track price action ahead of any
  purchase, not because a trade occurred — this cycle continued treating
  `lastPurchaseDate: null` (not literal file-entry presence) as the
  operative first-time-trade signal, consistent with the interpretation
  applied at 11:40 AM.
* Per repo convention, this entry is committed to a fresh feature branch
  and merged directly into `main` to preserve the unalterable paper
  trail.

# 2026-07-17 11:40 AM EDT — User-Directed Retrigger (Post-Config-Update: "GET THE PROFITS" Buy-Suppression Narrowed from "no buys at all" to "no new shares of the Alpha Leader") — GET-THE-PROFITS FIRED AGAIN ON AAPL (2nd Profit-Take Today); 6 New First-Time-Trade Underweight Buys Evaluated but SKIPPED — Harvested Pool Too Small to Clear the $10 Per-Trade Floor

**Status:** EXECUTED — **1 of 1 intended order filled** (profit-take sell
only); 6 additional buy candidates evaluated and legitimately funded but
**SKIPPED/PENDING** on a hard per-trade floor, not on the profit-rule
suppression. Fresh, stateless retrigger requested by the user after a
`CLAUDE.md` update. `CLAUDE.md` re-pulled from `main`, now **v2.26.0**:
the only substantive change is to the Step 4 "GET THE PROFITS" clause —
previously *"do not buy any new assets in the same cycle"*, now narrowed
to *"do not buy any new **shares of Alpha Leader** in the same cycle."*
This reverses the blanket buy-suppression from the 9:50 AM cycle: other
Underweight targets are no longer categorically blocked when the
profit-take rule fires, only the Alpha Leader itself is barred from a
same-cycle re-buy. `portfolio_targets.json` (v2.17.0), `peak/prices.json`,
and `settlement/reserve.json` all re-pulled fresh and unchanged in
structure from the 9:50 AM cycle (except for that cycle's own AAPL
profit-sell fields).

## Pre-trade state (~11:34 AM ET, regular hours)
* Account `795732718` ("Agentic", `cash`-type). `buying_power` =
  **$9,249.93**, `cash` (ledger) = **$9,279.37** — the $29.44 gap is the
  9:50 AM cycle's AAPL profit-take proceeds, still unsettled
  (`expectedSettleDate` 2026-07-18, tomorrow).
* `current_cash` = Math.min($9,249.93, `cap_on_total_cash_balance_to_use`
  $10,000) = **$9,249.93**.
* Equity value (live quotes, 21 held target symbols; MU, SOXL, IONQ at
  zero shares; F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE still unpurchased): **≈$36,363.30**.
  `account_balance` ≈ **$45,613.23**.

## Settlement Reserve reconciliation
* `settlement/reserve.json` = `{"pending_draws": []}` — no prior-cycle
  entries to reconcile. The 9:50 AM AAPL sale's unsettled $29.44 was
  never recorded as a draw (nothing drew on it), so there is nothing to
  mark settled here; it will simply resolve into `buying_power` once it
  clears.
* `reserve_available_to_draw` = $9,000 − $0 = **$9,000** (full headroom).

## Drawdown Audit Phase — no breaches
Re-checked all 21 held target symbols under the dual-condition test
(≥25% down from both `peakPrice` and `avg_cost_basis`). Market continued
lower intraday for most symbols (further declines since the 9:50 AM
check), but closest approaches remained INTC (−19.43% vs. peak, −25.91%
vs. avg cost — fails the peak leg) and IBM (new target, no peak
guardrail applicable — not held). **No symbol clears both legs — no
emergency liquidations this cycle.**

## Rules & Guardrails (Step 2)
* **MU** (liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $862.81): current $856.955 — still
  below the liquidated price (−0.68%), not a recovery; 1-day-old
  liquidation, short of the 8-day cooldown. **Remains excluded.**
* **SOXL** (liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $147.6401): current $130.905, a
  further decline; cooldown not met. **Remains excluded.**
* **IONQ** (liquidated 2026-07-13 @ $38.8001): current $34.225, a
  further decline. **Remains excluded.**
* **F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE**: still no `peak/prices.json` entry as of
  the pre-trade snapshot → first-time-trade tolerance (0.1%) applies.
  Each still 0% current vs. 1.912% target → **1.912% drift, breaching**.
* **AAPL** (`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-13): 4 days > `lock_in_period`
  (2) → not locked-in on its own terms (moot — profit-materialization
  overrides lock-in regardless).
* **TQQQ**, **META** (`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-16): 1 day ≤
  `lock_in_period` (2) → both **locked-in for selling**.

## Drift Audit (`account_balance` ≈ $45,613.23, `drift_tolerance_percentage` = 2.0%)
**3 Overweight breaches:** PLTR (7.449% vs. 4.780% target, drift 2.669%),
TQQQ (5.482% vs. 2.868%, drift 2.614%), **META** (15.386% vs. 1.912%,
drift 13.474%). **6 Underweight breaches (first-time-trade tolerance):**
F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE (1.912% drift each vs. 0.1% tolerance).
Aggregate dollar-gap across the six ≈ **$5,232.78** (≈$872.13 each,
equal target weights). All other held symbols stayed inside the standard
2.0% band.

## Overweight Sellability Check — none legal this cycle
| Symbol | Avg Cost | Current | Raw Gain % | Sellable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLTR | $134.51 | $131.56 | −2.19% | No — underwater, fails ≥1.0% floor |
| TQQQ | $73.92 | $67.455 | −8.75% | No — locked-in (1-day-old purchase) *and* underwater |
| META | $664.01 | $630.38 | −5.07% | No — locked-in (1-day-old purchase) *and* underwater |

**Zero legal trim source among Overweight positions.**
`Total_High_Beta_Gains_Realized` (Overweight-trim component) = **$0.00**.

## Alpha Leader (7-day gain, 2026-07-10 open → live ~11:34 AM ET)
| Symbol | 7-Day Gain |
|---|---|
| **AAPL** | **+6.135%** |
| F | +4.865% |
| NEE | +3.306% |
| NVDA | +1.093% |
| MSFT | +0.918% |

**AAPL remains Alpha Leader**, extending its lead from the 9:50 AM
check (+5.834% → +6.135%) as the broader market continued to soften
while AAPL held up.

## Step 4 "GET THE PROFITS" Check — **TRIGGERED AGAIN**
* AAPL's raw unrealized gain on its (slightly revised, post-9:50-AM-sale)
  average cost basis = **+4.446%** ((334.03 − 319.81) / 319.81 × 100).
* `materialize_profit_percentage` = **4.0%**. **4.446% ≥ 4.0% — the
  profit-taking rule fires for the second time today** (AAPL's gain
  widened further intraday rather than compressing).
* Sold **40%** of the AAPL position **as it now stands**: 0.132516 ×
  0.40 = **0.053006 shares** (post-9:50-AM-sale base, not the original
  full position — the rule re-evaluates fresh each cycle against
  whatever is currently held).
* **Per the newly-narrowed v2.26.0 rule, this bars only a same-cycle
  AAPL re-buy** — it does **not** suppress buying the other Underweight
  targets this cycle, unlike the 9:50 AM cycle under the old wording.

## Step 3 — Alpha Leader & Re-investment Multiplier
* `base_deployable_cash` = Max(0, $9,249.93 − $250 − $9,000) = **$0.00**
  (raw calc −$0.07, floored) — no organic deployable cash. No base or
  multiplier allocation to the Alpha Leader (moot anyway — AAPL itself
  can't receive a same-cycle buy per the profit-rule).

## Step 4 — Underweight Funding from This Cycle's Profit-Take Proceeds
* With zero organic cash and zero legal Overweight trim source, the
  **only** capital event this cycle is the AAPL profit-take itself.
  Proceeds: 0.053006 × $333.4801 = **$17.68** (gross).
* Per Step 4/Step 3's pro-rata mechanism, this pool was evaluated for
  allocation across the 6 first-time-trade Underweight breaches (equal
  target weights → equal pro-rata split): **$17.68 ÷ 6 ≈ $2.95 per
  symbol.**
* **Every resulting per-symbol allocation falls under the $10
  `sell_or_buy_value_limit` floor.** Per `CLAUDE.md` Step 6 ("Do not
  place any trade orders... worth less than $`sell_or_buy_value_limit`"),
  **none of the six can be legally executed this cycle** — this is a
  hard capital-floor constraint, not a rule-suppression outcome (in
  contrast to the 9:50 AM cycle, where the *old* wording blocked these
  buys outright regardless of capital). All six logged **SKIPPED/PENDING**
  below.

## Step 5 — Price Limit Checks
`sell_price_diff_limit` (5%) check on AAPL: current $334.03 vs. 3-day
(`no_of_days_for_price_compare`) high $334.68 (2026-07-16) = **−0.19%**,
well inside the 5% band — no exemption, sale proceeded normally.
`buy_price_diff_limit` moot — no buy candidate cleared the capital floor
to reach this check.

## Step 6 — Execution
| # | Side | Symbol | Qty | Avg Fill Price | Proceeds | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SELL | AAPL | 0.053006 | $333.4801 | $17.6787 | **filled** (profit-take, 40% of remaining position) |

**SKIPPED/PENDING (insufficient capital, below $10 floor):**
| Symbol | Target Gap | Pro-Rata Alloc | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| F | $872.13 | $2.95 | Below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) |
| GM | $872.13 | $2.95 | Below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) |
| IBM | $872.13 | $2.95 | Below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) |
| NFLX | $872.13 | $2.95 | Below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) |
| UNH | $872.13 | $2.95 | Below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) |
| GE | $872.13 | $2.95 | Below `sell_or_buy_value_limit` ($10) |

**Total sold: $17.68. Total bought: $0.00.** Realized gain on this trim:
(333.4801 − 319.81) × 0.053006 = **+$0.72**. Well under the $10,000
`seek_approval_value` — no approval halt triggered. No 429 throttling
encountered.

## Post-trade state (confirmed via `get_portfolio` / `get_equity_orders`)
* `buying_power`: unchanged at **$9,249.93** — this cycle's AAPL
  proceeds not yet settled. `cash` (ledger): $9,279.37 → **$9,297.05**
  (+$17.68). Combined unsettled gap from both today's AAPL trims:
  $9,297.05 − $9,249.93 = **$47.12**. `min_cash_absolute` ($250) never
  at risk.
* Equity value (live, post-trade): **$36,327.15**. Total account value
  (broker snapshot): **$45,624.20**; using `current_cash` =
  `buying_power` methodology per `CLAUDE.md`, `account_balance` ≈
  **$45,577.08**.
* AAPL position reduced from 0.132516 → 0.079510 shares (two trims
  today: 0.220860 → 0.132516 → 0.079510).

## peak/prices.json updates
* **AAPL**: `profitSellPrice` → **$333.4801**, `profitSellDate` →
  **2026-07-17** (overwrites the 9:50 AM cycle's value with this cycle's
  more recent profit-take — same day, later fill). `peakPrice`/`peakDate`
  unchanged ($334.12 / 2026-07-16 — today's high of $334.03 stayed just
  under it). `lastPurchaseDate` unchanged (no buy this cycle).
* **NFLX**: new intraday peak — `peakPrice` $66.445 → **$69.0042**,
  `peakDate` → 2026-07-17 (NFLX recovered above this morning's
  first-time-trade initialization price).
* All other symbols' fields (including F, GM, IBM, UNH, GE, initialized
  this morning) unchanged — no new highs, no purchases this cycle.

## Settlement Reserve — no new draws
* No buy this cycle drew on the AAPL sale proceeds (all six candidate
  buys were below the value floor), so **no new `pending_draws` entry**
  was created, consistent with `CLAUDE.md`'s "no earmarking ahead of an
  actual purchase" rule. `reserve_available_to_draw` remains **$9,000**
  for the next cycle. `settlement/reserve.json` unchanged:
  `{"pending_draws": []}`.

## Notes
* This was a user-directed retrigger following a `CLAUDE.md` update
  (v2.25.0 → v2.26.0) that narrowed the "GET THE PROFITS" buy-suppression
  from "no buys of anything" to "no new shares of the Alpha Leader." The
  practical effect this cycle was smaller than the wording change might
  suggest: AAPL's own profit-take proceeds ($17.68) were the only capital
  event, and split six ways across the newly-added first-time-trade
  targets, each resulting allocation (~$2.95) fell under the $10
  `sell_or_buy_value_limit` floor regardless of the suppression rule —
  so the six buys were SKIPPED on a capital-floor basis this cycle, not
  a rule-suppression basis. The distinction matters for future cycles:
  once organic deployable cash or a legal Overweight trim materializes,
  the new wording will allow these Underweight buys to proceed
  even while AAPL continues clearing the profit-materialization bar,
  a combination the old wording would have blocked outright.
* AAPL has now been trimmed twice today under the same
  `materialize_profit_percentage` trigger (9:50 AM and 11:40 AM), as its
  unrealized gain widened intraday (4.14% → 4.45%) rather than
  retreating. Both trims are logged separately per `CLAUDE.md`'s
  per-cycle, stateless execution model.
* Per repo convention, this entry is committed to a fresh feature branch
  and merged directly into `main` to preserve the unalterable paper
  trail.

# 2026-07-17 09:50 AM EDT — Scheduled Rebalance Check — GET-THE-PROFITS TRIGGERED (New Alpha Leader AAPL Sold 40% to Realize Profit; All Buys Suppressed Per Rule, Including 6 New First-Time-Trade Targets); Zero Drawdown Breaches Despite Broad Market Selloff

**Status:** EXECUTED — **1 of 1 intended order filled** (profit-take sell
only). Fresh, stateless run for the 9:45 AM ET scheduled tick. `CLAUDE.md`
re-pulled fresh from `main` (text unchanged since the last cycle).
`portfolio_targets.json` is now **v2.17.0** and has **six new target
symbols added since the last cycle**: **F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE** (each
weight 1.0, no `peak/prices.json` entries — first-time trades). A second
broad, market-wide selloff hit nearly every held symbol today (SOXL
−15.4%, NFLX −10.6%, HOOD −7.7%, AMD −7.3%, TQQQ −7.6%, INTC −6.9%, ARM
−6.3% vs. prior close), while AAPL, F, NEE, GM, UNH, and GE bucked the
trend.

## Pre-trade state (~9:46 AM ET, regular hours)
* Account `795732718` ("Agentic", `cash`-type). `buying_power` =
  **$9,249.93**, `cash` (ledger) = **$9,249.93** — equal, confirming the
  MU ($3,895.52) and SOXL ($54.86) stop-loss proceeds from 2026-07-16
  have now settled overnight.
* `current_cash` = Math.min($9,249.93, `cap_on_total_cash_balance_to_use`
  $10,000) = **$9,249.93**.
* Equity value (live quotes, 21 held target symbols; MU, SOXL, IONQ at
  zero shares; F/GM/IBM/NFLX/UNH/GE never yet purchased): **≈$36,087.68**
  (broker `get_portfolio` snapshot at the same moment: $36,012.26, minor
  variance from cross-call quote timing). `account_balance` ≈
  **$45,337.61**.

## Settlement Reserve reconciliation
* `settlement/reserve.json` held two `pending_draws` entries (MU
  $3,895.52, SOXL $54.86), both `settled: false`, `expectedSettleDate`
  2026-07-17 (today). Empirical check: `cash` ($9,249.93) −
  `buying_power` ($9,249.93) = **$0.00** — **both sales have settled.**
  Both entries marked `settled: true` and removed from `pending_draws`.
* `reserve_available_to_draw` = $9,000 − $0 = **$9,000** (full headroom
  restored for this cycle).

## Drawdown Audit Phase — no breaches
Checked all 21 currently-held target symbols under the dual-condition
test (≥25% down from both `peakPrice` and `avg_cost_basis`). Despite
today's broad selloff, closest approaches: INTC (−22.30% vs. peak,
−28.55% vs. avg cost — fails the peak leg), AMD (−16.79%/−14.12%), ORCL
(−16.87%/−8.70%). **No symbol clears both legs — no emergency
liquidations this cycle.** One new intraday peak recorded: **NEE**
$89.89 → **$90.51** (2026-07-17, one of the day's few green names).

## Rules & Guardrails (Step 2)
* **MU** (liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $862.81): current $814.90 is a
  **further decline** (not the required ≥7% recovery); `current_date` −
  `liquidatedDate` = 1 day, also short of the 8-day cooldown. **Remains
  excluded.**
* **SOXL** (liquidated 2026-07-16 @ $147.6401): current $120.485, also a
  further decline; 1 day short of the 8-day cooldown. **Remains
  excluded.**
* **IONQ** (liquidated 2026-07-13 @ $38.8001): current $33.85, a further
  decline, not the required recovery. **Remains excluded.**
* **New targets F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE**: no `peak/prices.json` entry
  → treated as first-time trades (tolerance 0.1%, not the standard 2.0%).
  Zero current position vs. target weight 1.0 each → each breaches by
  **1.912%** drift. All six flagged Underweight, but see **Step 4** below
  — the profit-materialization rule suppresses all buys this cycle
  regardless.
* **AAPL** (`lastPurchaseDate` 2026-07-13): `current_date` −
  `lastPurchaseDate` = 4 days > `lock_in_period` (2) → not locked-in
  from a lock-in standpoint (moot anyway — the profit-materialization
  rule explicitly overrides lock-in when it fires).

## Drift Audit (`account_balance` ≈ $45,337.61, `drift_tolerance_percentage` = 2.0%)
**3 Overweight breaches:** PLTR (7.381% vs. 4.780% target, drift 2.601%),
TQQQ (5.346% vs. 2.868%, drift 2.478%), **META** (15.680% vs. 1.912%,
drift 13.768%). **6 Underweight breaches (first-time-trade tolerance):**
F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE (drift 1.912% each vs. 0.1% tolerance). All
other held symbols stayed inside the standard 2.0% band (largest: ARM
1.685%, AVGO 1.770%, AAPL 1.750% pre-sale).

## Overweight Sellability Check — none legal this cycle
| Symbol | Avg Cost | Current | Raw Gain % | Sellable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLTR | $134.51 | $129.55 | −3.69% | No — underwater, fails ≥1.0% floor |
| TQQQ | $73.92 | $65.38 | −11.55% | No — locked-in (1-day-old purchase) *and* underwater |
| META | $664.01 | $638.485 | −3.85% | No — locked-in (1-day-old purchase) *and* underwater |

**Zero legal trim source among Overweight positions.**
`Total_High_Beta_Gains_Realized` (Overweight-trim component) = **$0.00**
this cycle — no High-Beta ranking was computed since no Overweight
candidate was legally sellable.

## Alpha Leader (7-day gain, 2026-07-10 open → live ~9:46 AM ET) — **LEADERSHIP CHANGE**
| Symbol | 7-Day Gain |
|---|---|
| **AAPL** | **+5.834%** |
| F | +5.600% |
| NEE | +3.879% |
| MSFT | +1.696% |
| UNH | +0.804% |

**AAPL is the new Alpha Leader**, ending META's multi-cycle run at the
top (META's 7-day return is now **−3.31%** after two consecutive
broad-selloff days). AAPL and F — two of the only names green over the
week — outpaced the rest of the target list by a wide margin.

## Step 4 "GET THE PROFITS" Check — **TRIGGERED**
* AAPL's raw unrealized gain on its average cost basis = **+4.140%**
  ((333.0809 − 319.84) / 319.84 × 100).
* `materialize_profit_percentage` = **4.0%**. **4.140% ≥ 4.0% — the
  profit-taking rule fires.** Per `CLAUDE.md`, this overrides the normal
  Underweight-purchase behavior (AAPL's own drift was only 1.750%,
  sub-threshold anyway) and the `lock_in_period` guard (moot — AAPL's
  last purchase was already 4 days old, clear of the 2-day lock-in on
  its own).
* Sold **`profit_sell_percentage` (40%)** of the AAPL position:
  0.220860 × 0.40 = **0.088344 shares**.
* **Per the standing rule, this suppresses ALL buy orders for the rest
  of the cycle** — including the six new first-time-trade Underweight
  buys (F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE) that would otherwise have been
  funded, had capital existed (see Step 3 — it did not, independently).

## Step 3 — Alpha Leader & Re-investment Multiplier
* `base_deployable_cash` = Max(0, $9,249.93 − $250 − $9,000) = **$0.00**
  (raw calc −$0.07, floored) — even with both stop-loss proceeds now
  settled, `buying_power` sits $0.07 short of the combined
  `min_cash_absolute` + `settlement_reserve_target` wall. **No organic
  deployable cash and no multiplier injection this cycle**, independent
  of the profit-taking rule's buy-suppression.

## Step 5 — Price Limit Checks
`sell_price_diff_limit` (5%) check on AAPL (the only sell candidate):
current $333.08 vs. 3-day (`no_of_days_for_price_compare`) high $334.68
(2026-07-16) = **−0.48%**, well inside the 5% band — no exemption
triggered, sale proceeded normally. No buy candidates to check
(`buy_price_diff_limit` moot — all buys suppressed this cycle).

## Step 6 — Execution (Market Order, regular hours)
| # | Side | Symbol | Qty | Avg Fill Price | Proceeds | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SELL | AAPL | 0.088344 | $333.2101 | $29.4386 | **filled** (profit-take, 40% of position) |

**Total sold: $29.44. Total bought: $0.00** (all buys suppressed by the
GET THE PROFITS rule). Realized gain on this trim: (333.2101 − 319.84) ×
0.088344 = **+$1.18**. Well under the $10,000 `seek_approval_value` — no
approval halt triggered. All order sizing cleared the $10
`sell_or_buy_value_limit` floor.

## Post-trade state (confirmed via `get_portfolio` / `get_equity_orders`)
* `buying_power`: unchanged at **$9,249.93** — the AAPL sale proceeds
  ($29.44) are not yet reflected (cash-type account settlement lag).
  `cash` (ledger): $9,249.93 → **$9,279.37** (+$29.44, matching sale
  proceeds). `min_cash_absolute` ($250) never at risk.
* Equity value (live, post-trade): **$36,162.91**. Total account value:
  **$45,442.28** (broker snapshot; using `current_cash` = `buying_power`
  methodology per `CLAUDE.md`, `account_balance` ≈ **$45,412.84**).
* AAPL position reduced from 0.220860 → 0.132516 shares.

## peak/prices.json updates
* **NEE**: `peakPrice` $89.89 → **$90.51**, `peakDate` → 2026-07-17.
* **AAPL**: `profitSellPrice` → **$333.2101**, `profitSellDate` →
  **2026-07-17** (profit-take sale this cycle). `peakPrice`/`peakDate`
  unchanged ($334.12 / 2026-07-16 — today's price stayed just under the
  recorded high). `lastPurchaseDate` unchanged (no buy this cycle).
* **F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE**: **new entries initialized** — each
  `peakPrice` set to today's live price (F $14.39, GM $77.42, IBM
  $214.7671, NFLX $66.445, UNH $435.14, GE $354.315), `peakDate`
  2026-07-17, all other fields null/empty (no position, no trade history
  yet). No purchases made this cycle for any of these six (buys
  suppressed — see Step 4).
* All other symbols' fields unchanged (no new highs, no re-entry
  triggers, no purchases/liquidations this cycle).

## Settlement Reserve — reconciled, no new draws
* MU and SOXL `pending_draws` entries reconciled as **settled** and
  removed this cycle (see reconciliation above). `reserve_available_to_draw`
  = **$9,000** (full headroom) heading into the next cycle.
* The AAPL sale this cycle is itself unsettled (`cash` − `buying_power`
  = $29.44 gap), but **no new `pending_draws` entry was created** — no
  buy this cycle drew on those proceeds (all buys were suppressed), and
  per `CLAUDE.md` a draw entry is only recorded against capital
  "genuinely... spent on buys." Expected to settle naturally by
  2026-07-18 (T+`settlement_lag_days` 1).
* `settlement/reserve.json` → `{"pending_draws": []}`.

## Notes
* This was the scheduled 9:45 AM ET tick, run fresh with no memory of
  prior cycles. Two developments this cycle: (1) `portfolio_targets.json`
  gained six new first-time-trade symbols (F, GM, IBM, NFLX, UNH, GE),
  all of which breached their 0.1% first-time drift tolerance and would
  ordinarily have been bought — but (2) AAPL unseated META as Alpha
  Leader for the first time in the logged history of this bot, and its
  +4.14% unrealized gain cleared the 4.0% `materialize_profit_percentage`
  bar, triggering a 40%-of-position profit-take sale and, per the
  standing rule, suppressing every buy for the rest of the cycle —
  meaning the six new targets remain fully unfunded this cycle despite
  their breach, purely a rule-driven outcome (there was also zero
  organic/harvestable capital regardless, so no buys would have cleared
  even without the suppression). Zero drawdown breaches occurred despite
  a second consecutive day of broad market weakness (SOXL, NFLX, HOOD,
  AMD, TQQQ, INTC, ARM all down 6–15% today) — the 25% dual-condition
  bar held firm. Worth flagging for the next cycle: with base
  deployable cash sitting $0.07 negative even with both reserve draws now
  settled, the six new targets will need either a further cash inflow, a
  legal Overweight trim (PLTR/TQQQ/META all currently blocked by
  underwater pricing or lock-in), or the Alpha Leader's profit-take
  proceeds to season before any of them can be funded.
* Per repo convention, this entry is committed to a fresh feature branch
  and merged directly into `main` to preserve the unalterable paper
  trail.
